These templates will help you bend your natural language when prompting for songs, and the examples will get you familiar with what to expect as a response. Then you can either modify one of the prompts provided or use the templates to generate your own. 

We’ll start with a basic prompt, then get as specific as possible with the current models. 

Right now, it’s difficult to get Chat GPT to follow a rhyme scheme closely. Putting AAAA seems to be the best, but often produces AABB.

## The Current state of GPT songwriting

A theme that you'll find with this learning resource, particularly dealing with songwriting right now through the GPT3.5 turbo model is that it has trouble both remembering where the practices are, and actually executing the things that it claims it understands. 

The biggest impact I've seen is with rhyme scheme and verse length. While asking for 32 or 16 bar verses will get you 8, and rhyming four bars in a row is a rarity.

**The GPT-4 model update improves** not only single song, but keeping a longer theme for album generation.

- **Updates in GPT-4**
    1. Rhyme scheme: GPT-4 has improved its understanding of rhyme schemes and can generate lyrics with more consistent rhyme patterns. While it may not always achieve perfect rhyming, the model can now more effectively align with the requested rhyme scheme.
    2. Verse length: GPT-4 can generate verses of varying lengths more accurately based on user requests. If you ask for a 16 or 32-bar verse, the model will attempt to produce lyrics with the specified length. Although there might still be occasional discrepancies, the output is more consistent than with previous models.
    3. Thematic consistency: GPT-4 is better at maintaining thematic consistency throughout a song. This means that the generated lyrics will adhere more closely to the topic or theme specified by the user.
    4. Melodic integration: Although GPT-4 is primarily a text-based model, it has made progress in understanding the relationship between lyrics and melody. This allows the model to generate lyrics that better fit a given melody or musical structure.
    5. Enhanced creativity: GPT-4 demonstrates improved creativity in its songwriting abilities. This means that the generated lyrics will be more unique and engaging, while still adhering to common songwriting practices.

## Overcoming Limitations

Take full advantage of the plentiful nature of chat GPT, and open your mind to new routes to do things, such as generating an extra list of ideas or structure to ideas to make songs more intricate. ChatGPT has a linear output (ignorant of future output  and works well with a well defined structure. 

## **Your Mission**

1. Learn each parameters the model is supposed to accept.
2. Have some faith that in the future the model will get better at handling those parameters.
3. Compensate
4. Get creative

Step one. Get to know every single parameter, as they are listed here, and further explore each one in your way. This will let you know exactly what is working and how it is working. One way to mess around is to edit the example prompts and send it.
